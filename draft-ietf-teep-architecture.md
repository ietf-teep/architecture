--- abstract

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment that
enforces that any code within that environment cannot be tampered with,
and that any data used by such code cannot be read or tampered with
by any code outside that environment.
This architecture document motivates the design and standardization
of a protocol for managing the lifecycle of trusted applications
running inside such a TEE.

#  Introduction
Applications executing in a device are exposed to many different attacks
intended to compromise the execution of the application or reveal the
data upon which those applications are operating. These attacks increase
with the number of other applications on the device, with such other
applications coming from potentially untrustworthy sources. The
potential for attacks further increases with the complexity of features
and applications on devices, and the unintended interactions among those
features and applications. The danger of attacks on a system increases
as the sensitivity of the applications or data on the device increases.
As an example, exposure of emails from a mail client is likely to be of
concern to its owner, but a compromise of a banking application raises
even greater concerns.

The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) concept is designed to execute
applications in a protected environment that enforces that any code 
within that environment cannot be tampered with, 
and that any data used by such code 
cannot be read or tampered with by any code outside that environment, 
including by a commodity operating system (if present).
In a system with multiple TEEs, this also means that code in one TEE 
cannot be read or tampered with by code in the other TEE.

This separation reduces the possibility
of a successful attack on application components and the data contained inside the
TEE. Typically, application components are chosen to execute inside a TEE because
those application components perform security sensitive operations or operate on
sensitive data. An application component running inside a TEE is referred to as a
Trusted Application (TA), while an application running outside any TEE, i.e., in the
Rich Execution Environment (REE),
is referred to as an Untrusted Application. In the example of a banking application, 
code that relates to the authentication protocol could reside in a TA while the 
application logic including HTTP protocol parsing could be contained in the 
Untrusted Application.  In addition, processing of credit card numbers or account balances could be done in a TA as it is sensitive data.
The precise code split is ultimately a decision of the 
developer based on the assets he or she wants to protect according to the threat model. 

TEEs use hardware enforcement combined with software protection to secure TAs and
its data. TEEs typically offer a more limited set of services to TAs than is 
normally available to Untrusted Applications.

Not all TEEs are the same, however, and different vendors may have different
implementations of TEEs with different security properties, different
features, and different control mechanisms to operate on TAs. Some
vendors may themselves market multiple different TEEs with different
properties attuned to different markets. A device vendor may integrate
one or more TEEs into their devices depending on market needs.

To simplify the life of TA developers interacting
with TAs in a TEE, an interoperable protocol for managing TAs running in
different TEEs of various devices is needed. This software update protocol 
needs to make sure that compatible trusted and untrusted components (if any) of an 
application are installed on the correct device. In this TEE ecosystem,
there often arises a need for an external trusted party to verify the
identity, claims, and rights of TA developers, devices, and their TEEs.
This trusted third party is the Trusted Application Manager (TAM).

The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) protocol addresses
the following problems:

  - An installer of an Untrusted Application that depends on a given TA
    wants to request installation of that TA in the device's TEE
    so that the Untrusted Application can complete, but the TEE
    needs to verify whether such a TA is actually authorized to
    run in the TEE and consume potentially scarce TEE resources.

  - A TA developer providing a TA whose code itself is considered
    confidential wants to determine 
    security-relevant information of a device before allowing their
    TA to be provisioned to the TEE within the device. An example 
    is the verification of 
    the type of TEE included in a device and that it is capable of 
    providing the security protections required.

  - A TEE in a device wants to determine whether an entity
    that wants to manage a TA in the device is authorized to manage TAs
    in the TEE, and what TAs the entity is permitted to manage.

  - A Device Administrator wants to determine if a TA exists (is
    installed) on a device (in the TEE), and if not, install the TA in
    the TEE.

  - A Device Administrator wants to check whether a TA in a
    device's TEE is the most up-to-date version, and if not, update the
    TA in the TEE.

  - A Device Administrator wants to remove a TA from a device's TEE if
    the TA developer is no longer maintaining that TA, when the TA has
    been revoked or is not used for other reasons anymore (e.g., due to an 
    expired subscription).

  - A TA developer wants to define the relationship
    between cooperating TAs under the TA developer's control, and 
    specify whether
    the TAs can communicate, share data, and/or share key material.

#  Terminology {#terminology}

The following terms are used:

  - Device: A physical piece of hardware that hosts one or more TEEs,
    often along with
    an REE.

  - Device Administrator:  An entity that is responsible for administration
    of a device, which could be the Device Owner. A Device Administrator
    has privileges on the device to install and remove Untrusted Applications and TAs,
    approve or reject Trust Anchors, and approve or reject TA developers,
    among possibly other privileges on the device. A Device Administrator can
    manage the list of allowed TAMs by modifying the list of Trust
    Anchors on the device. Although a Device Administrator may have
    privileges and device-specific controls to locally administer a
    device, the Device Administrator may choose to remotely
    administer a device through a TAM.

  - Device Owner: A device is always owned by someone. In some cases, it is common for
    the (primary) device user to also own the device, making the device
    user/owner also the Device Administrator. In enterprise environments
    it is more common for the enterprise to own the device, and any device
    user has no or limited administration rights. In this case, the
    enterprise appoints a Device Administrator that is not the device
    owner.

  - Device User: A human being that uses a device. Many devices have
    a single device user. Some devices have a primary device user with
    other human beings as secondary device users (e.g., parent allowing
    children to use their tablet or laptop). Other devices are not used
    by a human being and hence have no device user. Relates to Device Owner
    and Device Administrator.

  - Raw Public Key: The raw public key only consists of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   structure of a PKIX certificate that carries the parameters necessary
   to describe the public key. Other serialization formats that do not 
   rely on ASN.1 may also be used. 

  - Rich Execution Environment (REE): An environment that is provided
    and governed by a typical OS (e.g., Linux, Windows, Android, iOS),
    potentially in conjunction with other supporting operating systems
    and hypervisors; it is outside of any TEE. This environment and
    applications running on it are considered untrusted (or more precisely,
    less trusted than a TEE).

  - Trust Anchor: As defined in {{RFC6024}} and {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}},
    "A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public
    key and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital
    signatures, and the associated data is used to constrain the types
    of information for which the trust anchor is authoritative."
    The Trust Anchor may be a certificate or it may be a raw public key
    along with additional data if necessary such as its public key
    algorithm and parameters.

  - Trust Anchor Store: As defined in {{RFC6024}}, "A trust anchor
    store is a set of one or more trust anchors stored in a device.
    A device may have more than one trust anchor store, each of which
    may be used by one or more applications."  As noted in {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}},
    a Trust Anchor Store must resist modification against unauthorized
    insertion, deletion, and modification.

  - Trusted Application (TA): An application (or, in some implementations, an application component) that runs in a TEE.

  - Trusted Application (TA) Developer: An entity that develops one or
    more TAs.

  - Trusted Application (TA) Signer: An entity that signs a TA with
    a key that a TEE will trust.  The signer might or might not be the
    same entity as the TA Developer.  For example, a TA might
    be signed (or re-signed) by a Device Administrator if the TEE will
    only trust the Device Administrator.  A TA might also be encrypted,
    if the code is considered confidential.
    
  - Trusted Application Manager (TAM): An entity that manages Trusted
    Applications (TAs) running in TEEs of various devices.

  - Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): An execution environment that enforces that
    only authorized code can execute within the TEE, and data used by that
    code cannot be read or tampered with by code outside the TEE.
    A TEE also generally has a device unique credential that cannot be cloned.
    There are multiple technologies that can be used to implement
    a TEE, and the level of security achieved varies accordingly.
    In addition, TEEs typically use an isolation mechanism between Trusted Applications to ensure
    that one TA cannot read, modify or delete the data and code of another
    TA.

  - Untrusted Application: An application running in an REE. An Untrusted Application 
    might depend on one or more TAs.

# Use Cases

## Payment

A payment application in a mobile device requires high security and
trust in the hosting device. Payments initiated from a mobile
device can use a Trusted Application
to provide strong identification and proof of transaction.

For a mobile payment application, some biometric identification
information could also be stored in a TEE. The mobile payment
application can use such information for unlocking the device and 
for local identification of the user.

A trusted user interface (UI) may be used in a mobile device to
prevent malicious software from stealing sensitive user input data.
Such an implementation often relies on a TEE for providing access 
to peripherals, such as PIN input or a trusted display, so that
the REE cannot observe or tamper with the user input or output.

## Authentication

For better security of authentication, a device may store its
keys and cryptographic libraries inside a TEE limiting access to 
cryptographic functions via a well-defined interface and thereby 
reducing access to keying material. 

## Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) has been posing threats to 
critical infrastructure because of weak security in devices.
It is desirable that IoT devices can prevent malware from
manipulating actuators (e.g., unlocking a door), or
stealing or modifying sensitive data, such as authentication credentials
in the device. A TEE can be the best way to implement such IoT
security functions.


## Confidential Cloud Computing

A tenant can store sensitive data in a TEE in a cloud computing
server such that only the tenant can access the data, preventing
the cloud hosting provider from accessing the data. A tenant can
run TAs inside a server TEE for secure operation and enhanced
data security. This provides benefits not only to tenants with
better data security but also to cloud hosting providers for reduced
liability and increased cloud adoption.

{: #notionalarch title="Notional Architecture of TEEP"}

  - TA Signers and Device Administrators utilize the services
    of a TAM to manage TAs on devices. TA Signers do not directly interact
    with devices. Device Administators may elect to use a TAM for remote administration
    of TAs instead of managing each device directly.

  - Trusted Application Manager (TAM):  A TAM is responsible for performing lifecycle
    management activity on TAs on behalf of TA Signers
    and Device Administrators. This includes installation and
    deletion of TAs, and may include, for example, over-the-air
    updates to keep TAs up-to-date and clean up when a version
    should be removed. TAMs may provide services that make it easier for
    TA Signers or Device Administators to use the TAM's service to manage multiple devices,
    although that is not required of a TAM.

    The TAM performs its management of TAs on the device through
    interactions with a device's TEEP Broker, which relays
    messages between a TAM and a TEEP Agent running inside the TEE. 
    TEEP authentication is performed between a TAM and a TEEP Agent.

    As shown in
    {{notionalarch}}, the TAM cannot directly contact a TEEP Agent, but must
    wait for the TEEP Broker to contact
    the TAM requesting a particular service. This architecture is
    intentional in order to accommodate network and application firewalls
    that normally protect user and enterprise devices from arbitrary
    connections from external network entities.

    A TAM may be publicly available for use by many TA Signers, or a TAM
    may be private, and accessible by only one or a limited number of
    TA Signers. It is expected that many manufacturers and network carriers
    will run their own private TAM.

    A TA Signer or Device Administrator chooses a particular TAM based on
    whether the TAM is trusted by a device or set of devices. The
    TAM is trusted by a device if the TAM's public key is, or chains up to,
    an authorized
    Trust Anchor in the device. A TA Signer or Device Administrator may run
    their own TAM, but the devices they wish to manage must include
    this TAM's public key/certificate {{RFC5280}}, or a certificate it chains up to, in the
    Trust Anchor Store.

    A TA Signer or Device Administrator is free to utilize multiple TAMs. This may
    be required for managing TAs on multiple different types of devices
    from different manufacturers, or mobile devices on
    different network carriers, since
    the Trust Anchor Store on these different devices may contain different
    TAMs. A Device Administrator may be able to add their own TAM's
    public key or certificate to the Trust Anchor Store on all their devices,
    overcoming this limitation.

    Any entity is free to operate a TAM. For a TAM to be successful, it must
    have its public key or certificate installed in a device's Trust Anchor Store.
    A TAM may set up a relationship with device manufacturers or network carriers
    to have them install the TAM's keys in their device's Trust Anchor Store.
    Alternatively, a TAM may publish its certificate and allow Device
    Administrators to install the TAM's certificate in their devices as
    an after-market-action.

  - TEEP Broker: A TEEP Broker is an application component running in a Rich
    Execution Environment (REE) that enables the message protocol exchange between
    a TAM and a TEE in a device. A TEEP Broker does not process messages
    on behalf of a TEE, but merely is responsible for relaying messages from
    the TAM to the TEE, and for returning the TEE's responses to the TAM.
    In devices with no REE (e.g., a microcontroller where all code runs
    in an environment that meets the definition of a Trusted Execution
    Environment in {{terminology}}), the TEEP Broker would be absent and
    instead the
    TEEP protocol transport would be implemented inside the TEE itself.

  - TEEP Agent: The TEEP Agent is a processing module running inside
    a TEE that receives TAM requests (typically relayed via a TEEP Broker
    that runs in an REE). A TEEP Agent in the TEE may parse requests or
    forward requests to other processing modules in a TEE, which is
    up to a TEE provider's implementation. A response message
    corresponding to a TAM request is sent back to the TAM, again typically
    relayed via a TEEP Broker.

  - Certification Authority (CA): A CA is an entity that issues digital 
    certificates (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the 
    binding between the data items in a certificate {{?RFC4949}}. 
    Certificates are then used for authenticating a device, a TAM, or a 
    TA Signer, as discussed in {{trustanchors}}.  The CAs do not need to be the same;
    different CAs can be chosen by each TAM, and different device CAs
    can be used by different device manufacturers.

## Multiple TEEs in a Device

Some devices might implement multiple TEEs. 
In these cases, there might be one shared TEEP Broker 
that interacts with all the TEEs in the device.
However, some TEEs (for example, SGX {{SGX}}) present themselves as separate containers
within memory without a controlling manager within the TEE. As such,
there might be multiple TEEP Brokers in the REE,
where each TEEP Broker communicates with one or more TEEs associated with it.

It is up to the REE and the Untrusted Applications
how they select the correct TEEP Broker. Verification that the correct TA
has been reached then becomes a matter of properly verifying TA attestations,
which are unforgeable. 

The multiple TEEP Broker approach is shown in the diagram below.
For brevity, TEEP Broker 2 is shown interacting with only one TAM and Untrusted Application and only one TEE, but
no such limitations are intended to be implied in the architecture.

{: #notionalarch2 title="Notional Architecture of TEEP with multiple TEEs"}

In the diagram above, TEEP Broker 1 controls interactions with the TAs in TEE-1,
and TEEP Broker 2 controls interactions with the TAs in TEE-2. This presents some
challenges for a TAM in completely managing the device, since a TAM may not
interact with all the TEEP Brokers on a particular platform. In addition, since
TEEs may be physically separated, with wholly different resources, there may be no
need for TEEP Brokers to share information on installed TAs or resource usage.

## Multiple TAMs and Relationship to TAs

As shown in {{notionalarch2}}, a TEEP Broker provides communication between 
one or more TEEP Agents and
one or more TAMs. The selection of which TAM to communicate with might be
made with or without input from an Untrusted Application, but is ultimately
the decision of a TEEP Agent.

A TEEP Agent is assumed to be able to determine, for any given TA,
whether that TA is installed (or minimally, is running) in a TEE with
which the TEEP Agent is associated.

Each TA is digitally signed, protecting its integrity, and linking
the TA back to the TA Signer. The TA Signer is often the TA Developer, but in
some cases might be another party such as a Device Administrator
or other party
to whom the code has been licensed (in which case the same code might
be signed by multiple licensees and distributed as if it were different TAs).

A TA Signer selects one or more TAMs and communicates the TA(s) to the TAM.
For example, the TA Signer might choose TAMs based upon the markets into which the TAM can provide access. There
may be TAMs that provide services to specific types of devices, or device
operating systems, or specific geographical regions or network carriers. A TA Signer may be
motivated to utilize multiple TAMs in order to maximize market penetration
and availability on multiple types of devices. This means that the same TA
will often be available through multiple TAMs.

When the developer of an Untrusted Application that depends on a TA publishes
the Untrusted Application to an app store or other app repository, the developer
optionally binds the Untrusted Application with a manifest that identifies
what TAMs can be contacted for
the TA. In some situations, a TA may only be available via a single TAM - this is likely the case
for enterprise applications or TA Signers serving a closed community. For broad public apps,
there will likely be multiple TAMs in the manifest - one servicing one brand of mobile
device and another servicing a different manufacturer, etc. Because different devices
and different manufacturers trust different TAMs, the manifest can include multiple
TAMs that support the required TA.

When a TEEP Broker receives a request (see the RequestTA API in {{apis}}) from an Untrusted Application to install a TA,
a list of TAM URIs may be provided for that TA, and the request is passed to the TEEP Agent.
If the TEEP Agent decides that the TA needs to be installed, the TEEP Agent selects a single TAM URI
that is consistent with the list of trusted TAMs provisioned in the TEEP Agent, invokes the
HTTP transport for TEEP to connect to the TAM URI, and begins a TEEP protocol exchange.  When the TEEP Agent
subsequently receives the TA to install and the TA's manifest indicates dependencies
on any other trusted components, each dependency can include a list of TAM URIs for the
relevant dependency.  If such dependencies exist that are prerequisites to install the TA,
then the TEEP Agent recursively follows the same procedure for each dependency that needs to be installed
or updated, including selecting a TAM URI that is consistent with the list of trusted TAMs provisioned
on the device, and beginning a TEEP exchange.  If multiple TAM URIs are considered trusted,
only one needs to be contacted and they can be attempted in some order until one responds.

Separate from the Untrusted Application's manifest, this framework relies on the use of the manifest 
format in {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}} for expressing how to install a TA, as well as any
dependencies on other TEE components and versions.
That is, dependencies from TAs on other TEE components can be expressed in a SUIT manifest,
including dependencies on any other TAs, or trusted OS code (if any), or trusted firmware.
Installation steps can also be expressed in a SUIT manifest.

For example, TEEs compliant
with GlobalPlatform may have a notion of a "security domain" (which is a grouping of
one or more TAs installed on a device, that can share information within such a group)
that must be created and into which one or more TAs can then be installed. It is thus up
to the SUIT manifest to express a dependency on having such a security domain existing
or being created first, as appropriate.

Updating a TA may cause compatibility issues with any Untrusted Applications or other
components that depend on the updated TA, just like updating the OS or a shared library
could impact an Untrusted Application.  Thus, an implementation needs to take into
account such issues.

## Untrusted Apps, Trusted Apps, and Personalization Data

In TEEP, there is an explicit relationship and dependence between an Untrusted Application
in an REE and one or more TAs in a TEE, as shown in {{notionalarch2}}.
For most purposes, an Untrusted Application that uses one or more TAs in a TEE
appears no different from any other Untrusted Application in the REE. However, the way
the Untrusted Application and its corresponding TAs are packaged, delivered, and installed on
the device can vary. The variations depend on whether the Untrusted Application and TA are bundled
together or are provided separately, and this has implications to the management of
the TAs in a TEE. In addition to the Untrusted Application and TA(s), the TA(s) and/or TEE may require
some additional data to personalize the TA to the device or a user.
This personalization data may depend on the type of TEE, a particular TEE instance, the TA, and even the user of the device; an example of
personalization data might be a secret symmetric key used by the TA to communicate with some service. Implementations must support encryption of
personalization data to preserve the confidentiality of potentially
sensitive data contained within it and support integrity protection
of the personalization data.
Other than the requirement to support confidentiality and integrity protection,
the TEEP architecture places no limitations or requirements on the personalization data.

There are three possible cases for bundling of an Untrusted Application, TA(s), and personalization data:

  1. The Untrusted Application, TA(s), and personalization data are all bundled together in a single
     package by a TA Signer and either provided to the TEEP Broker through the TAM, or provided separately (with encrypted personalization data), with
     key material needed to decrypt and install the personalization
     data and TA provided by a TAM.

  2. The Untrusted Application and the TA(s) are bundled together in a single package, which a TAM or
     a publicly accessible app store maintains, and the personalization data
     is separately provided by the TA Signer's TAM.

  3. All components are independent. The Untrusted Application is installed through some
     independent or device-specific mechanism, and the TAM provides the TA and personalization
     data from the TA Signer. Delivery of the TA and personalization data may be combined or separate.

The TEEP protocol treats each TA, any dependencies the TA has, and personalization data as
separate components with separate installation steps that are expressed in SUIT manifests,
and a SUIT manifest might contain or reference multiple binaries (see {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}}
for more details). The TEEP Agent is responsible for handling any installation steps
that need to be performed inside the TEE, such as decryption of private TA binaries or
personalization data.

In order to better understand these cases, it is helpful to review actual implementations of TEEs and their application delivery mechanisms.

### Example: Application Delivery Mechanisms in Intel SGX

In Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), the Untrusted Application and TA are typically bundled into the
same package (Case 2). The TA 
exists in the package as a shared library (.so or .dll). The Untrusted Application loads the TA into
an SGX enclave when the Untrusted Application needs the TA. This organization makes it easy to maintain
compatibility between the Untrusted Application and the TA, since they are updated together. It is
entirely possible to create an Untrusted Application that loads an external TA into an SGX enclave, and
use that TA (Case 3). In this case, the Untrusted Application would require a reference to an external
file or download such a file dynamically, place the contents of the file into memory, and
load that as a TA. Obviously, such file or downloaded content must be properly formatted
and signed for it to be accepted by the SGX TEE. In SGX, for Case 2 and Case 3, the
personalization data is normally loaded into the SGX enclave (the TA) after the TA has
started. Although Case 1 is possible with SGX, there are no instances of this known to
be in use at this time, since such a construction would require a special installation
program and SGX TA to receive the encrypted binary, decrypt it, separate it into the
three different elements, and then install all three. This installation is complex
because the Untrusted Application decrypted inside the TEE must be passed out of the TEE to an
installer in the REE which would install the Untrusted Application; this assumes that the Untrusted
Application package includes the TA code also, since otherwise there is a significant problem in getting
the SGX enclave code (the TA) from the TEE, through the installer, and into the Untrusted Application
in a trusted fashion. Finally, the personalization data would need to be sent out of the
TEE (encrypted in an SGX enclave-to-enclave manner) to the REE's installation app, which
would pass this data to the installed Untrusted Application, which would in turn send this data
to the SGX enclave (TA). This complexity is due to the fact that each SGX enclave is separate
and does not have direct communication to other SGX enclaves.

### Example: Application Delivery Mechanisms in Arm TrustZone

In Arm TrustZone {{TrustZone}} for A-class devices, the Untrusted Application and TA may or may not be
bundled together. This differs from SGX since in TrustZone the TA lifetime is not inherently tied
to a specific Untrused Application process lifetime as occurs in SGX.  A TA is loaded by
a trusted OS running in the TEE such as a GlobalPlatform compliant TEE, where the trusted OS is 
separate from the OS in the REE.
Thus Cases 2 and 3 are equally applicable.  In addition, it is possible for TAs to communicate
with each other without involving any Untrusted Application, and so the complexity of Case 1
is lower than in the SGX example.  Thus, Case 1 is possible as well, though still more
complex than Cases 2 and 3.

## Entity Relations

This architecture leverages asymmetric cryptography to
authenticate a device to a TAM. Additionally, a TEEP Agent
in a device authenticates a TAM. The
provisioning of Trust Anchors to a device may be different from
one use case to the other. A Device Administrator may want to
have the capability to control what TAs are allowed.
A device manufacturer enables verification by one or more TAMs and by TA Signers; 
it may embed a list of default Trust Anchors into the TEEP Agent
and TEE for TAM trust verification and TA signature verification.

{: #experience title="Example Developer Experience"}

{{experience}} shows an example where the same developer builds and signs
two applications: (a) an Untrusted Application; (b) a TA
that provides some security functions to be run inside
a TEE.  This example assumes that the developer, the TEE, and the TAM have
previously been provisioned with certificates.  

At step 1, the developer authors the two applications.

At step 2, the developer uploads the
Untrusted Application (2a) to an Application Store. 
In this example, the developer is also the TA Signer, and so generates
a signed TA.
The developer can then either bundle the signed TA
with the Untrusted Application, or the developer can provide the signed TA
to a TAM that will be managing the TA in various devices.

At step 3, a user
will go to an Application Store to download the Untrusted
Application (where the arrow indicates the direction of data transfer).

At step 4, since the Untrusted Application depends on the TA,
installing the Untrusted Application will trigger TA installation
by initiating communication with a TAM. The TEEP Agent
will interact with TAM via a TEEP Broker that faciliates communications between a TAM
and the TEEP Agent in TEE.

Some TA installation implementations might ask for a user's consent. In other
implementations,
a Device Administrator might choose what Untrusted Applications and related TAs to
be installed. A user consent flow is out of scope of the TEEP architecture.

The main components consist of a set of standard messages created by
a TAM to deliver TA management commands to a device,
and device attestation and response messages created by a TEE that
responds to a TAM's message.

It should be noted that network communication capability is generally
not available in TAs in today's TEE-powered devices.  Consequently, Trusted
Applications generally rely on broker in the REE to provide access to
network functionality in the REE.  A broker does not need to know the actual
content of messages to facilitate such access.

Similarly, since the TEEP Agent runs inside a TEE, the TEEP Agent generally
relies on a TEEP Broker in the REE to provide network access, and relay
TAM requests to the TEEP Agent and relay the responses back to the TAM.

# Keys and Certificate Types {#trustanchors}

This architecture leverages the following credentials, which allow
delivering end-to-end security between a TAM and a TEEP Agent.

{{keys}} summarizes the relationships between various keys and where
they are stored.  Each public/private key identifies a TA Signer, TAM, or TEE,
and gets a certificate that chains up to some trust anchor.  A list of trusted
certificates is then used to check a presented certificate against.

Different CAs can be used for different
types of certificates.  TEEP messages are always signed, where the signer
key is the message originator's private key, such as that of a TAM
or a TEE.  In addition to the keys shown in {{keys}},
there may be additional keys used for attestation.  Refer to the 
RATS Architecture {{I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}} for more discussion.

{: #keys title="Signature Keys"}

Note that personalization data is not included in the table above. 
The use of personalization data is dependent on how TAs are used 
and what their security requirements are. 

TEEP requests from a TAM to a TEEP Agent are signed with the TAM
private key (for authentication and integrity protection). 
Personalization data and TA binaries can be encrypted with a key 
that is established with a content encryption key established with 
the TEE public key (to provide confidentiality). Conversely, 
TEEP responses from a TEEP Agent to a TAM can be signed with the TEE 
private key.

The TEE key pair and certificate are thus used for authenticating the TEE
to a remote TAM, and for sending private data to the TEE.  Often, 
the key pair is burned into the TEE by the
TEE manufacturer and the key pair and its certificate are valid for
the expected lifetime of the TEE.  A TAM provider is responsible
for configuring the TAM's Trust Anchor Store with the manufacturer certificates or CAs
that are used to sign TEE keys. This is discussed further in
{{trust-anchors-in-tam}} below.

The TAM key pair and certificate are used for authenticating a TAM
to a remote TEE, and for sending private data to the TAM.  A TAM provider
is responsible for acquiring a
certificate from a CA that is trusted by the TEEs it manages. This
is discussed further in {{trust-anchors-in-teep-agent}} below.

The TA Signer key pair and certificate are used to sign TAs that the TEE
will consider authorized to execute.  TEEs must be configured with
the certificates or keys that it considers authorized to sign TAs
that it will execute.  This is discussed further in
{{trust-anchors-in-tee}} below.

## Trust Anchors in a TEEP Agent {#trust-anchors-in-teep-agent}

A TEEP Agent's Trust Anchor Store contains a list of Trust Anchors, which
are CA certificates that sign various TAM certificates.  The list
is typically preloaded at manufacturing time, and
can be updated using the TEEP protocol if the TEE has some form of
"Trust Anchor Manager TA" that has Trust Anchors in its configuration data.
Thus, Trust Anchors can be updated similar to updating the configuration data
for any other TA.

When Trust Anchor update is carried out, it is imperative that any update
must maintain integrity where only an authentic Trust Anchor list from
a device manufacturer or a Device Administrator is accepted. Details
are out of scope of the architecture and can be addressed in a protocol
document.

Before a TAM can begin operation in the marketplace to support a
device with a particular TEE, it must obtain a TAM
certificate from a CA or the raw public key of a TAM that is listed in 
the Trust Anchor Store of the TEEP Agent.

## Trust Anchors in a TEE {#trust-anchors-in-tee}

A TEE determines whether TA binaries are allowed to execute by 
verifying whether their signature can be verified using certificate(s) or raw public key(s)
in the TEE's Trust Anchor Store. The list
is typically preloaded at manufacturing time, and
can be updated using the TEEP protocol if the TEE has some form of
"Trust Anchor Manager TA" that has Trust Anchors in its configuration data.
Thus, Trust Anchors can be updated similar to updating the configuration data
for any other TA, as discussed in {{trust-anchors-in-teep-agent}}.

## Trust Anchors in a TAM {#trust-anchors-in-tam}

The Trust Anchor Store in a TAM consists of a list of Trust Anchors, which
are certificates that sign various device TEE certificates.  A TAM will accept a
device for TA management if the TEE in the device uses a TEE certificate
that is chained to a certificate or raw public key that the TAM trusts, is contained in an allow list, 
is not found on a block list, and/or fulfills any other policy criteria.

## Scalability

This architecture uses a PKI (including self-signed certificates). Trust Anchors exist on the devices to
enable the TEE to authenticate TAMs and TA Signers, and TAMs use Trust Anchors to
authenticate TEEs.  When a PKI is used, many intermediate CA
certificates can chain to a root certificate, each of which can issue
many certificates.  This makes the protocol highly scalable.  New
factories that produce TEEs can join the ecosystem.  In this case,
such a factory can get an intermediate CA certificate from one of the
existing roots without requiring that TAMs are updated with
information about the new device factory.  Likewise, new TAMs can
join the ecosystem, providing they are issued a TAM certificate that
chains to an existing root whereby existing TEEs will be allowed to
be personalized by the TAM without requiring changes to the TEE
itself.  This enables the ecosystem to scale, and avoids the need for
centralized databases of all TEEs produced or all TAMs that exist or
all TA Signers that exist.

## Message Security

Messages created by a TAM are used to deliver TA
management commands to a device, and device attestation and
messages created by the device TEE to respond to TAM messages.

These messages are signed end-to-end between a TEEP Agent and a TAM.
Confidentiality is provided by encrypting sensitive payloads (such as
personalization data and attestation evidence), rather than encrypting the
messages themselves.  Using encrypted payloads is important to ensure
that only the targeted device TEE or TAM is able to decrypt and view
the actual content.

# TEEP Broker {#broker}

A TEE and TAs often do not have the capability to directly communicate
outside of the hosting device.  For example, GlobalPlatform
{{GPTEE}} specifies one such architecture.  This calls for a software
module in the REE world to handle network communication with a TAM.

A TEEP Broker is an application component
running in the REE of the device or an SDK that facilitates
communication between a TAM and a TEE.  It also provides interfaces for
Untrusted Applications to query and trigger TA installation that the
application needs to use.

An Untrusted Application might communicate with a TEEP Broker at runtime
to trigger TA installation itself, or an Untrusted Application might simply
have a metadata file that describes the TAs it depends on and the associated TAM(s) for each TA,
and an REE Application Installer can inspect this
application metadata file and invoke the TEEP Broker to trigger TA installation
on behalf of the Untrusted
Application without requiring the Untrusted Application to run first.

## Role of the TEEP Broker

A TEEP Broker abstracts the message exchanges with a TEE in a device.
The input data is originated from a TAM or the first initialization
call to trigger a TA installation.

The Broker doesn't need to parse a message content received from a TAM
that should be processed by a TEE (see the ProcessTeepMessage API in {{apis}}).
When a device has more than one TEE, one TEEP Broker per TEE could
be present in the REE. A TEEP Broker interacts with a TEEP Agent inside
a TEE.

A TAM message may indicate the target TEE where a TA should be installed.
A compliant TEEP protocol should include a target TEE identifier for a
TEEP Broker when multiple TEEs are present.

The Broker relays the response messages generated from a TEEP Agent in a TEE
to the TAM.

The Broker only needs to return a (transport) error message if the TEE is
not reachable for some reason.  Other errors are represented as
response messages returned from the TEE which will then be passed to
the TAM.

## TEEP Broker Implementation Consideration

As depicted in {{broker-models}}, there are multiple ways in which a TEEP Broker
can be implemented, with more or fewer layers being inside the TEE.  For example, in
model A, the model with the smallest TEE footprint, only the TEEP implementation is inside
the TEE, whereas the TEEP/HTTP implementation is in the TEEP Broker outside the TEE.

{: #broker-models title="TEEP Broker Models"}

In other models, additional layers are moved into the TEE, increasing the TEE footprint,
with the Broker either containing or calling the topmost protocol layer outside of the TEE.
An implementation is free to choose any of these models.

   TEEP Broker implementers should consider methods of distribution, scope and
   concurrency on devices and runtime options.

### TEEP Broker APIs {#apis}

The following conceptual APIs exist from a TEEP Broker to a TEEP Agent:

1. RequestTA: A notification from an REE application (e.g., an installer,
   or an Untrusted Application) that it depends on a given TA, which may or may not
   already be installed in the TEE.

2. ProcessTeepMessage: A message arriving from the network, to be delivered
   to the TEEP Agent for processing.

3. RequestPolicyCheck: A hint (e.g., based on a timer) that the TEEP Agent
   may wish to contact the TAM for any changes, without the device itself
   needing any particular change.

4. ProcessError: A notification that the TEEP Broker could not deliver an outbound
   TEEP message to a TAM.

For comparison, similar APIs may exist on the TAM side, where a Broker may or may not
exist, depending on whether the TAM uses a TEE or not:

1. ProcessConnect: A notification that an incoming TEEP session is being requested by a TEEP Agent.

2. ProcessTeepMessage: A message arriving from the network, to be delivered
   to the TAM for processing.

For further discussion on these APIs, see {{I-D.ietf-teep-otrp-over-http}}.

### TEEP Broker Distribution

The Broker installation is commonly carried out at OEM time. A user
can dynamically download and install a Broker on-demand.

# Attestation
Attestation is the process through which one entity (an Attester) presents "evidence", in the form
of a series of claims, to another entity (a Verifier), and provides sufficient proof that the claims
are true. Different Verifiers may require different degrees of confidence in attestation proofs
and not all attestations are acceptable to every verifier.  A third entity (a Relying Party)
can then use "attestation results", in the form of another series of claims, from a Verifier
to make authorization decisions.  (See {{I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}} for more discussion.)

In TEEP, as depicted in {{attestation-roles}},
the primary purpose of an attestation is to allow a device (the Attester) to prove to a TAM
(the Relying Party) that a TEE in the device has particular properties, was built by a particular
manufacturer, and/or is executing a particular TA. Other claims are possible; TEEP
does not limit the claims that may appear in evidence or attestation results,
but defines a minimal set of attestation result claims
required for TEEP to operate properly. Extensions to these claims are possible.
Other standards or groups may define the format and semantics
of extended claims.

{: #attestation-roles title="TEEP Attestation Roles"}        

As of the writing of this specification, device and TEE attestations have not been standardized
across the market. Different devices, manufacturers, and TEEs support different attestation
protocols. In order for TEEP to be inclusive, it is agnostic to the format of evidence,
allowing proprietary or standardized formats to be used between a TEE and a verifier (which may or may not
be colocated in the TAM), as long as the format supports encryption of
any information that is considered sensitive.

However, it should be recognized
that not all Verifiers may be able to process all proprietary forms of attestation evidence.
Similarly, the TEEP protocol is agnostic as to the format of attestation results, and the protocol
(if any) used between the TAM and a verifier, as long as they convey at least the required set of claims
in some format. Note that the respective attestation algorithms are not defined in the TEEP protocol itself; see {{I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}} and {{I-D.ietf-teep-protocol}} for more discussion. 

There are a number of considerations that need to be considered when appraising
evidence provided by a TEE, including:

  - What security measures a manufacturer takes when provisioning keys into devices/TEEs;

  - What hardware and software components have access to the attestation keys of the TEE;

  - The source or local verification of claims within an attestation prior to a TEE signing a set of claims;

  - The level of protection afforded to attestation keys against exfiltration, modification, and side channel attacks;

  - The limitations of use applied to TEE attestation keys;

  - The processes in place to discover or detect TEE breaches; and

  - The revocation and recovery process of TEE attestation keys.

Some TAMs may require additional claims in order to properly authorize a device or TEE.  The specific
format for these additional claims are outside the scope of this specification, but the TEEP protocol
allows these additional claims to be included in the attestation messages.

For more discussion of the attestation and appraisal process, see
the RATS Architecture {{I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}}.

## Information Required in TEEP Claims

  - Device Identifying Information: TEEP attestations may need to uniquely identify a device to the TAM.
    Unique device identification allows the TAM to provide services to the device, such as managing installed
    TAs, and providing subscriptions to services, and locating device-specific keying material to
    communicate with or authenticate the device. In some use cases it may be sufficient to identify 
    only the class of the device. The security and privacy requirements regarding device identification 
    will vary with the type of TA provisioned to the TEE. 

  - TEE Identifying Information: The type of TEE that generated this attestation must be identified,
    including version identification information
    such as the hardware, firmware, and software version of the TEE, as applicable by the
    TEE type. TEE manufacturer information for the TEE is
    required in order to disambiguate the same TEE type created by different manufacturers and
    address considerations around manufacturer provisioning, keying and support for the TEE.

  - Freshness Proof: A claim that includes freshness information must be included, such as a nonce
    or timestamp.

# Algorithm and Attestation Agility

RFC 7696 {{RFC7696}} outlines the requirements to migrate from one
mandatory-to-implement cryptographic algorithm suite to another over time.
This feature is also known as crypto agility. Protocol evolution
is greatly simplified when crypto agility is considered
during the design of the protocol. In the case of the TEEP
protocol the diverse range of use cases, from trusted app
updates for smart phones and tablets to updates of code on
higher-end IoT devices, creates the need for different
mandatory-to-implement algorithms already from the start.

Crypto agility in TEEP concerns the use of symmetric as well
as asymmetric algorithms. In the context of TEEP, symmetric algorithms 
are used for encryption of TA binaries and personalization data 
whereas the asymmetric algorithms are mostly used for signing messages.

In addition to the use of cryptographic algorithms in TEEP, there
is also the need to make use of different attestation technologies.
A device must provide techniques to inform a TAM about the
attestation technology it supports. For many deployment cases it
is more likely for the TAM to support one or more attestation
techniques whereas the device may only support one.

# Security Considerations

## Broker Trust Model

The architecture enables the TAM to communicate, via a TEEP Broker, with the device's TEE
to manage TAs.  Since the TEEP Broker runs in a potentially vulnerable REE,
the TEEP Broker could, however, be (or be infected by) malware.
As such, all TAM messages are signed and sensitive
data is encrypted such that the TEEP Broker cannot modify or capture
sensitive data, but the TEEP Broker can still conduct DoS attacks
as discussed in {{compromised-ree}}.

A TEEP Agent in a TEE is responsible for protecting against potential attacks
from a compromised 
TEEP Broker or rogue malware in the REE. A rogue TEEP Broker
might send corrupted data to the TEEP Agent, or launch a DoS attack by sending a flood
of TEEP protocol requests. The TEEP Agent validates the signature of each TEEP protocol request
and checks the signing certificate against its Trust Anchors. To mitigate
DoS attacks, it might also add some protection
scheme such as a threshold on repeated requests or number of TAs that can be installed.

## Data Protection

It is the responsibility of the TAM to protect data on its servers.
Similarly, it is the responsibility of the TEE implementation to provides protection of
data against integrity and confidentiality attacks from outside the TEE.
TEEs that provide isolation among TAs within the TEE are likewise
responsible for protecting TA data against the REE and other TAs.
For example, this can be used to protect one user's or tenant's data
from compromise by another user/tenant, even if the attacker has TAs.

The protocol between TEEP Agents and TAMs similarly is responsible for
securely providing integrity and confidentiality protection against
adversaries between them. Since the transport protocol under the TEEP
protocol might be implemented outside a TEE, as discussed in {{broker}},
it cannot be relied upon for sufficient protection.  The TEEP protocol
provides integrity protection, but confidentiality must be provided by
payload security, i.e., using encrypted TA binaries and encrypted
attestation information.  See {{I-D.ietf-teep-protocol}} for more
discussion.

## Compromised REE {#compromised-ree}

It is possible that the REE of a device is compromised. If the REE is
compromised, several DoS attacks may be launched. The compromised REE
may terminate the TEEP Broker such that TEEP transactions cannot reach the TEE,
or might drop or delay messages between a TAM and a TEEP Agent.
However, while a DoS attack cannot be prevented, the REE cannot access
anything in the TEE if it is implemented correctly.
Some TEEs may have some watchdog scheme to observe REE state and mitigate DoS
attacks against it but most TEEs don't have such a capability.

In some other scenarios, the compromised REE may ask a TEEP Broker
to make repeated requests to a TEEP Agent in a TEE to install or
uninstall a TA.  A TA installation or uninstallation request constructed
by the TEEP Broker or REE will be rejected by the TEEP Agent because
the request won't have the correct signature from a TAM to pass the request
signature validation.

This can become a DoS attack by exhausting resources in a TEE with
repeated requests. In general, a DoS attack threat exists when the REE
is compromised, and a DoS attack can happen to other resources. The TEEP
architecture doesn't change this.

A compromised REE might also request initiating the full flow of
installation of TAs that are not necessary.
It may also repeat a prior legitimate TA installation
request. A TEEP Agent implementation is responsible for ensuring that it
can recognize and decline such repeated requests. It is also responsible
for protecting the resource usage allocated for TA management.

## Compromised CA

A root CA for TAM certificates might get compromised or its certificate might
expire, or a Trust Anchor other than a root CA certificate may also expire or
be compromised.
TEEs are responsible for validating the entire TAM certificate chain,
including the TAM certificate and any intermediate certificates up to
the root certificate.  Such validation includes checking for certificate
revocation.

If a TAM certificate chain validation fails, the TAM
might be rejected by a TEEP Agent.
To address this, some certificate chain update mechanism
is expected from TAM operators, so that the TAM can get
a new certificate chain that can be validated by a TEEP Agent.
In addition, the Trust Anchor in the TEEP Agent's Trust Anchor Store
may need to be updated.  To address this, some TEE Trust Anchor update 
mechanism is expected from device OEMs.

Similarly, 
a root CA for TEE certificates might get compromised or its certificate might
expire, or a Trust Anchor other than a root CA certificate may also expire or
be compromised.
TAMs are responsible for validating the entire TEE certificate chain,
including the TEE certificate and any intermediate certificates up to
the root certificate.  Such validation includes checking for certificate
revocation.

If a TEE certificate chain validation fails, the TEE
might be rejected by a TAM, subject to the TAM's policy.
To address this, some certificate chain update mechanism
is expected from device OEMs, so that the TEE can get
a new certificate chain that can be validated by a TAM.
In addition, the Trust Anchor in the TAM's Trust Anchor Store
may need to be updated.

## Compromised TAM

Device TEEs are responsible for validating the supplied TAM certificates
to determine that the TAM is trustworthy.

## Malicious TA Removal

It is possible that a rogue developer distributes a malicious Untrusted 
Application and intends to get a malicious TA installed. Such a TA
might be able to escape from malware detection by the REE, or access trusted
resources within the TEE (but could not access other TEEs, or access other
TA's if the TEE provides isolation between TAs).

It is the responsibility
of the TAM to not install malicious TAs in the first place. The TEEP
architecture allows a TEEP Agent to decide which TAMs it trusts via Trust Anchors, 
and delegates the TA authenticity check to the TAMs it trusts.

It may happen that a TA was previously considered trustworthy but is later
found to be buggy or compromised.
In this case, the TAM can initiate the removal of the TA by notifying devices 
to remove the TA (and potentially the REE or Device Owner to remove any Untrusted 
Application that depend on the TA).  If the TAM does not currently have a
connection to the TEEP Agent on a device, such a notification would occur
the next time connectivity does exist.  That is, to recover, the TEEP Agent
must be able to reach out to the TAM, for example whenever the 
RequestPolicyCheck API ({{apis}}) is invoked by a timer or other event.

Furthermore the policy in the Verifier in an attestation process can be
updated so that any evidence that includes the malicious TA would result
in an attestation failure.  There is, however, a time window during which
a malicious TA might be able to operate successfully, which is the
validity time of the previous attestation result.  For example, if
the Verifier in {{attestation-roles}} is updated to treat a previously
valid TA as no longer trustworthy, any attestation result it previously
generated saying that the TA is valid will continue to be used until
the attestation result expires.  As such, the TAM's Verifier should
take into account the acceptable time window when generating attestation
results. See {{I-D.ietf-rats-architecture}} for further discussion.

## Certificate Expiry and Renewal 

TEE device certificates are expected to be long lived, longer
than the lifetime of a device.  A TAM certificate usually has a
moderate lifetime of 2 to 5 years.  A TAM should get renewed or
rekeyed certificates.  The root CA certificates for a TAM, which are
embedded into the Trust Anchor Store in a device, should have long
lifetimes that don't require device Trust Anchor updates.  On the
other hand, it is imperative that OEMs or device providers plan for
support of Trust Anchor update in their shipped devices. 

For those cases where TEE devices are given certificates for which no good
expiration date can be assigned the recommendations in Section 4.1.2.5 of 
{{RFC5280}} are applicable.  

## Keeping Secrets from the TAM

In some scenarios, it is desirable to protect the TA binary or configuration
from being disclosed to the TAM that distributes them.  In such a scenario,
the files can be encrypted end-to-end between a TA Signer and a TEE.  However, there
must be some means of provisioning the decryption key into the TEE and/or some
means of the TA Signer securely learning a public key of the TEE that it can use to
encrypt.  One way to do this is for the TA Signer to run its own TAM so that it can
distribute the decryption key via the TEEP protocol, and the key file can be a
dependency in the manifest of the encrypted TA.  Thus, the TEEP Agent would
look at the TA manifest, determine there is a dependency with a TAM URI of the
TA Signer's TAM. The Agent would then install the dependency, and then continue with
the TA installation steps, including decrypting the TA binary with the relevant key.
