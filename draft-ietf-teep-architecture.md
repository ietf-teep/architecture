--- abstract

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment that
enforces that only authorized code can execute with that environment,
and that any data used by such code cannot be read or tampered with
by any code outside that environment.
This architecture document motivates the design and standardization
of a protocol for managing the lifecycle of trusted applications
running inside a TEE.

#  Introduction
Applications executing in a device are exposed to many different attacks
intended to compromise the execution of the application, or reveal the
data upon which those applications are operating. These attacks increase
with the number of other applications on the device, with such other
applications coming from potentially untrustworthy sources. The
potential for attacks further increase with the complexity of features
and applications on devices, and the unintended interactions among those
features and applications. The danger of attacks on a system increases
as the sensitivity of the applications or data on the device increases.
As an example, exposure of emails from a mail client is likely to be of
concern to its owner, but a compromise of a banking application raises
even greater concerns.

The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) concept is designed to execute
applications in a protected environment that enforces that only authorized 
code can execute with that environment, and that any data used by such code 
cannot be read or tampered with by any code outside that environment,
including a commodity operating system (if present).

This separation reduces the possibility
of a successful attack on application components and the data contained inside the
TEE. Typically, application components are chosen to execute inside a TEE because
those application components perform security sensitive operations or operate on
sensitive data. An application component running inside a TEE is referred to as a
Trusted Application (TA), while an application running outside any TEE
is referred to as an Untrusted Application (UA).

The TEE typically uses hardware to enforce protections on the TA and its data, but
also presents a more limited set of services to applications inside the
TEE than is normally available to Untrusted Applications.

But not all TEEs are the same, and different vendors may have different
implementations of TEEs with different security properties, different
features, and different control mechanisms to operate on TAs. Some
vendors may themselves market multiple different TEEs with different
properties attuned to different markets. A device vendor may integrate
one or more TEEs into their devices depending on market needs.

To simplify the life of developers and service providers interacting
with TAs in a TEE, an interoperable protocol for managing TAs running in
different TEEs of various devices is needed. In this TEE ecosystem,
there often arises a need for an external trusted party to verify the
identity, claims, and rights of Service Providers (SP), devices, and their TEEs.
This trusted third party is the Trusted Application Manager (TAM).

The Trusted Execution Provisioning (TEEP) protocol addresses the following problems:

  - A Service Provider (SP) intending to provide services through a TA
    to users of a device needs to determine security-relevant
    information of a device before provisioning their TA to the TEE
    within the device. An example is the verification of 
    the type of TEE included in a device.

  - A TEE in a device needs to determine whether a Service Provider (SP)
    that wants to manage a TA in the device is authorized to manage TAs
    in the TEE, and what TAs the SP is permitted to manage.

  - The parties involved in the protocol must be able to attest that a
    TEE is genuine and capable of providing the security protections
    required by a particular TA.

  - A Service Provider (SP) must be able to determine if a TA exists (is
    installed) on a device (in the TEE), and if not, install the TA in
    the TEE.

  - A Service Provider (SP) must be able to check whether a TA in a
    device's TEE is the most up-to-date version, and if not, update the
    TA in the TEE.

  - A Service Provider (SP) must be able to remove a TA in a device's
    TEE if the SP is no longer offering such services or the services
    are being revoked from a particular user (or device). For example,
    if a subscription or contract for a particular service has expired,
    or a payment by the user has not been completed or has been rescinded.

  - A Service Provider (SP) must be able to define the relationship
    between cooperating TAs under the SP's control, and specify whether
    the TAs can communicate, share data, and/or share key material.

#  Terminology

The following terms are used:

  - Untrusted Application: An application running in a Rich Execution
    Environment, such as an Android, Windows, or iOS application.

  - Trusted Application Manager (TAM): An entity that manages Trusted
    Applications (TAs) running in different TEEs of various devices.

  - Device: A physical piece of hardware that hosts one or more TEEs,
    often along with
    a Rich Execution Environment. A Device contains a default list
    of Trust Anchors that identify entities (e.g., TAMs) that are
    trusted by the Device. This list is normally set by the Device
    Manufacturer, and may be governed by the Device's network carrier.
    The list of Trust Anchors is normally modifiable by the Device's
    owner or Device Administrator. However the Device manufacturer
    and network carrier may restrict some modifications, for example,
    by not allowing the manufacturer or carrier's Trust Anchor to be
    removed or disabled.

  - Rich Execution Environment (REE): An environment that is provided
    and governed by a typical OS (e.g., Linux, Windows, Android, iOS),
    potentially in conjunction with other supporting operating systems
    and hypervisors; it is outside of any TEE. This environment and
    applications running on it are considered untrusted.

  - Service Provider (SP): An entity that wishes to provide a service
    on Devices that requires the use of one or more Trusted Applications.
    A Service Provider requires the help of a TAM in order to provision
    the Trusted Applications to remote devices.

  - Device User: A human being that uses a device. Many devices have
    a single device user. Some devices have a primary device user with
    other human beings as secondary device users (e.g., parent allowing
    children to use their tablet or laptop). Other devices are not used
    by a human being and hence have no device user. Relates to Device Owner
    and Device Administrator.

  - Device Owner: A device is always owned by someone. In some cases, it is common for
    the (primary) device user to also own the device, making the device
    user/owner also the device administrator. In enterprise environments
    it is more common for the enterprise to own the device, and any device
    user has no or limited administration rights. In this case, the
    enterprise appoints a device administrator that is not the device
    owner.

  - Device Administrator (DA):  An entity that is responsible for administration
    of a Device, which could be the device owner. A Device Administrator
    has privileges on the Device to install and remove applications and TAs,
    approve or reject Trust Anchors, and approve or reject Service Providers,
    among possibly other privileges on the Device. A Device Administrator can
    manage the list of allowed TAMs by modifying the list of Trust
    Anchors on the Device. Although a Device Administrator may have
    privileges and Device-specific controls to locally administer a
    device, the Device Administrator may choose to remotely
    administrate a device through a TAM.

  - Trust Anchor: As defined in {{RFC6024}} and {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}},
    "A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public
    key and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital
    signatures, and the associated data is used to constrain the types
    of information for which the trust anchor is authoritative."
    The Trust Anchor may be a certificate or it may be a raw public key
    along with additional data if necessary such as its public key
    algorithm and parameters.

  - Trust Anchor Store: As defined in {{RFC6024}}, "A trust anchor
    store is a set of one or more trust anchors stored in a device.
    A device may have more than one trust anchor store, each of which
    may be used by one or more applications."  As noted in {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}},
    a trust anchor store must resist modification against unauthorized
    insertion, deletion, and modification.

  - Trusted Application (TA): An application component that runs in a TEE.

  - Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): An execution environment that enforces that
    only authorized code can execute within the TEE, and data used by that
    code cannot be read or tampered with by code outside the TEE.
    A TEE also generally has a device unique credential that cannot be cloned.
    There are multiple technologies that can be used to implement
    a TEE, and the level of security achieved varies accordingly.
    In addition, TEEs typically use an isolation mechanism between Trusted Applications to ensure
    that one TA cannot read, modify or delete the data and code of another
    TA.

# Use Cases

## Payment

A payment application in a mobile device requires high security and
trust about the hosting device. Payments initiated from a mobile
device can use a Trusted Application
to provide strong identification and proof of transaction.

For a mobile payment application, some biometric identification
information could also be stored in a TEE. The mobile payment
application can use such information for authentication.

A secure user interface (UI) may be used in a mobile device to
prevent malicious software from stealing sensitive user input data.
Such an application implementation often relies on a TEE for user
input protection.

## Authentication

For better security of authentication, a device may store its
sensitive authentication keys inside a TEE, providing
TEE-protected security key strength and trusted code execution.

## Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) has been posing threats to networks and
national infrastructures because of existing weak security in devices.
It is very desirable that IoT devices can prevent malware from
manipulating actuators (e.g., unlocking a door), or
stealing or modifying sensitive data such as authentication credentials
in the device. A TEE can be the best way to implement such IoT
security functions.

TEEs could be used to store variety of sensitive data for IoT devices.
For example, a TEE could be used in smart door locks to store a user's
biometric information for identification, and for protecting access
the locking mechanism.

## Confidential Cloud Computing

A tenant can store sensitive data in a TEE in a cloud computing
server such that only the tenant can access the data, preventing
the cloud hosting provider from accessing the data. A tenant can
run TAs inside a server TEE for secure operation and enhanced
data security. This provides benefits not only to tenants with
better data security but also to cloud hosting provider for reduced
liability and increased cloud adoption.

{: #notionalarch title="Notional Architecture of TEEP"}

  - Service Providers (SP) and Device Administrators (DA) utilize the services
    of a TAM to manage TAs on Devices. SPs do not directly interact
    with devices. DAs may elect to use a TAM for remote administration
    of TAs instead of managing each device directly.

  - Trusted Application Manager (TAM):  A TAM is responsible for performing lifecycle
    management activity on TA's on behalf of Service
    Providers and Device Administrators. This includes creation and
    deletion of TA's, and may include, for example, over-the-air
    updates to keep an SP's TAs up-to-date and clean up when a version
    should be removed. TAMs may provide services that make it easier for
    SPs or DAs to use the TAM's service to manage multiple devices,
    although that is not required of a TAM.

    The TAM performs its management of TA's through an
    interaction with a Device's TEEP Broker. As shown in
    {{notionalarch}}, the TAM cannot directly contact a Device, but must
    wait for the TEEP Broker to contact
    the TAM requesting a particular service. This architecture is
    intentional in order to accommodate network and application firewalls
    that normally protect user and enterprise devices from arbitrary
    connections from external network entities.

    A TAM may be publicly available for use by many SPs, or a TAM
    may be private, and accessible by only one or a limited number of
    SPs. It is expected that manufacturers and carriers will run their
    own private TAM. Another example of a private TAM is a TAM running as
    a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) within an SP.

    A SP or Device Administrator chooses a particular TAM based on
    whether the TAM is trusted by a Device or set of Devices. The
    TAM is trusted by a device if the TAM's public key is an authorized
    Trust Anchor in the Device. A SP or Device Administrator may run
    their own TAM, however the Devices they wish to manage must include
    this TAM's pubic key in the Trust Anchor list.

    A SP or Device Administrator is free to utilize multiple TAMs. This may
    be required for a SP to manage multiple different types of devices
    from different manufacturers, or devices on different carriers, since
    the Trust Anchor list on these different devices may contain different
    TAMs. A Device Administrator may be able to add their own TAM's
    public key or certificate to the Trust Anchor list on all their devices,
    overcoming this limitation.

    Any entity is free to operate a TAM. For a TAM to be successful, it must
    have its public key or certificate installed in Devices Trust Anchor list.
    A TAM may set up a relationship with device manufacturers or carriers
    to have them install the TAM's keys in their device's Trust Anchor list.
    Alternatively, a TAM may publish its certificate and allow Device
    Administrators to install the TAM's certificate in their devices as
    an after-market-action.

  - TEEP Broker: The TEEP Broker is an application component running in a Rich
    Execution Environment (REE) that enables the message protocol exchange between
    a TAM and a TEE in a device. The TEEP Broker does not process messages
    on behalf of a TEE, but merely is responsible for relaying messages from
    the TAM to the TEE, and for returning the TEE's responses to the TAM.

  - TEEP Agent: the TEEP Agent is a processing module running inside
    a TEE that receives TAM requests that are relayed via a TEEP Broker
    that runs in an REE. A TEEP Agent in the TEE may parse requests or
    forward requests to other processing modules in a TEE, which is
    up to a TEE provider's implementation. A response message
    corresponding to a TAM request is sent by a TEEP Agent back
    to a TEEP Broker.

  - Certification Authority (CA):  Certificate-based credentials used for
    authenticating a device, a TAM and an SP.  A device embeds a list
    of root certificates (Trust Anchors), from trusted CAs that a TAM
    will be validated against.  A TAM will remotely attest a device
    by checking whether a device comes with a certificate from a CA
    that the TAM trusts.  The CAs do not need to be the same;
    different CAs can be chosen by each TAM, and different device CAs
    can be used by different device manufacturers.

## Different Renditions of TEEP Architecture
There is nothing prohibiting a device from implementing multiple TEEs. In
addition, some TEEs (for example, SGX) present themselves as separate containers
within memory without a controlling manager within the TEE. In these cases,
the Rich Execution Environment hosts multiple TEEP brokers, where each Broker manages
a particular TEE or set of TEEs. Enumeration and access to the appropriate
TEEP Broker is up to the Rich Execution Environment and the Untrusted Applications. Verification that the correct TA
has been reached then becomes a matter of properly verifying TA attestations,
which are unforgeable. The multiple TEE approach is shown in the diagram below.
For brevity, TEEP Broker 2 is shown interacting with only one TAM and UA, but
no such limitation is intended to be implied in the architecture.

{: #notionalarch2 title="Notional Architecture of TEEP with multiple TEEs"}

In the diagram above, TEEP Broker 1 controls interactions with the TA's in TEE-1,
and TEEP Broker 2 controls interactions with the TA's in TEE-2. This presents some
challenges for a TAM in completely managing the device, since a TAM may not
interact with all the TEEP Brokers on a particular platform. In addition, since
TEE's may be physically separated, with wholly different resources, there may be no
need for TEEP Brokers to share information on installed TAs or resource usage.
However, the architecture guarantees that the TAM will receive all the relevant
information from the TEEP Broker to which it communicates.

## Multiple TAMs and Relationship to TAs

As shown in {{notionalarch2}}, the TEEP Broker provides connections from the TEE and
the Untrusted Application to one or more TAMs. The selection of which TAM to communicate with is
dependent on information from the Untrusted Application and is directly related to the TA.

When a SP offers a service which requires a TA, the SP associates that service with a
specific TA. The TA itself is digitally signed, protecting its integrity, but the
signature also links the TA back to the signer. The signer is usually the SP, but in
some cases may be another party that the SP trusts. The SP selects one or more TAMs
through which to offer their service, and communicates the information of the service
and the specific Untrusted Applications and TAs to the TAM.

The SP chooses TAMs based upon the markets into which the TAM can provide access. There
may be TAMs that provide services to specific types of mobile devices, or mobile device
operating systems, or specific geographical regions or network carriers. A SP may be
motivated to utilize multiple TAMs for its service in order to maximize market penetration
and availability on multiple types of devices. This likely means that the same service
will be available through multiple TAMs.

When the SP publishes the Untrusted Application to an app store or other app repositories, the SP
binds the Untrusted Application with a manifest that identifies what TAMs can be contacted for
the TA. In some situations, an SP may use only a single TAM - this is likely the case
for enterprise applications or SPs serving a closed community. For broad public apps,
there will likely be multiple TAMs in the manifest - one servicing one brand of mobile
device and another servicing a different manufacturer, etc. Because different devices
and different manufacturers trust different TAMs, the manifest will include different
TAMs that support this SP's Untrusted Application and TA. Multiple TAMs allow the SP to provide
their service and this app (and TA) to multiple different devices.

When a TEEP Broker receives a request from an Untrusted Application to install a TA,
a list of TAM URIs may be provided for that TA, and the request is passed to the TEEP Agent.
If the TEEP Agent decides that the TA needs to be installed, the TEEP Agent selects a single TAM URI
that is consistent with the list of trusted TAMs provisioned on the device invokes the
HTTP transport for TEEP to connect to the TAM URI and begins a TEEP protocol exchange.  When the TEEP Agent
subsequently receives the TA to install and the TA's manifest indicates dependencies
on any other trusted components, each dependency can include a list of TAM URIs for the
relevant dependency.  If such dependencies exist that are prerequisites to install the TA,
then the TEEP Agent recursively follows the same procedure for each dependency that needs to be installed
or updated, including selecting a TAM URI that is consistent with the list of trusted TAMs provisioned
on the device, and beginning a TEEP exchange.  If multiple TAM URIs are considered trusted,
only one needs to be contacted and they can be attempted in some order until one responds.

Separate from the Untrusted Application's manifest, this framework relies on the use of the manifest 
format in {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}} for expressing how to install the TA as well as
dependencies on other TEE components and versions.
That is, dependencies from TAs on other TEE components can be expressed in a SUIT manifest,
including dependencies on any other TAs, or trusted OS code (if any), or trusted firmware.
Installation steps can also be expressed in a SUIT manifest.

For example, TEE's compliant
with Global Platform may have a notion of a "security domain" (which is a grouping of
one or more TAs installed on a device, that can share information within such a group)
that must be created and into which one or more TAs can then be installed. It is thus up
to the SUIT manifest to express a dependency on having such a security domain existing
or being created first, as appropriate.

Updating a TA may cause compatibility issues with any Untrusted Applications or other
components that depend on the updated TA, just like updating the OS or a shared library
could impact an Untrusted Application.  Thus, an implementation needs to take into
account such issues.

## Untrusted Apps, Trusted Apps, and Personalization Data

In TEEP, there is an explicit relationship and dependence between the Untrusted Application
in the REE and one or more TAs in the TEE, as shown in {{notionalarch2}}.
For most purposes, an Untrusted Application that uses one or more TA's in a TEE
appears no different from any other Untrusted Application in the REE. However, the way
the Untrusted Application and its corresponding TA's are packaged, delivered, and installed on
the device can vary. The variations depend on whether the Untrusted Application and TA are bundled
together or are provided separately, and this has implications to the management of
the TAs in the TEE. In addition to the Untrusted Application and TA, the TA and/or TEE may require
some additional data to personalize the TA to the service provider or the device or a user.
This personalization data is dependent on the TEE, the TA and the SP; an example of
personalization data might be username and password of an account with
the SP, or a secret symmetric key used by the TA to communicate with the SP. The
personalization data may need to be encrypted to preserve the confidentiality of potentially
sensitive data contained within it. 

There are three possible cases for bundling of the Untrusted Application, TA, and personalization data:

  1. The Untrusted Application, TA, and personalization data are all bundled together in a single
     package by the SP and provided to the TEEP Broker through the TAM.

  2. The Untrusted Application and the TA are bundled together in a single package, which a TAM or
     a publicly accessible app store maintains, and the personalization data
     is separately provided by the SP's TAM.

  3. All components are independent. The Untrusted Application is installed through some
     independent or device-specific mechanism, and the TAM provides the TA and personalization
     data from the SP. Delivery of the TA and personalization data may be combined or separate.

The TEEP protocol treats the TA, any dependencies the TA has, and personalization data as
separate components with separate installation steps that are expressed in SUIT manifests,
and a SUIT manifest might contain or reference multiple binaries (see {{I-D.ietf-suit-manifest}
for more details). The TEEP Agent is responsible for handling any installation steps
that need to be performed inside the TEE, such as decryption of private TA bianries or
personalization data.

## Examples of Application Delivery Mechanisms in Existing TEEs

In order to better understand these cases, it is helpful to review actual implementations of TEEs and their application delivery mechanisms.

In Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), the Untrusted Application and TA are typically bundled into the
same package (Case 2). The TA 
exists in the package as a shared library (.so or .dll). The Untrusted Application loads the TA into
an SGX enclave when the Untrusted Application needs the TA. This organization makes it easy to maintain
compatibility between the Untrusted Application and the TA, since they are updated together. It is
entirely possible to create an Untrusted Application that loads an external TA into an SGX enclave and
use that TA (Case 3). In this case, the Untrusted Application would require a reference to an external
file or download such a file dynamically, place the contents of the file into memory, and
load that as a TA. Obviously, such file or downloaded content must be properly formatted
and signed for it to be accepted by the SGX TEE. In SGX, for Case 2 and Case 3, the
personalization data is normally loaded into the SGX enclave (the TA) after the TA has
started. Although Case 1 is possible with SGX, there are no instances of this known to
be in use at this time, since such a construction would require a special installation
program and SGX TA to receive the encrypted binary, decrypt it, separate it into the
three different elements, and then install all three. This installation is complex,
because the Untrusted Application decrypted inside the TEE must be passed out of the TEE to an
installer in the REE which would install the Untrusted Application; this assumes that the Untrusted
Application package includes the TA code also, since otherwise there is a significant problem in getting
the SGX enclave code (the TA) from the TEE, through the installer and into the Untrusted Application
in a trusted fashion. Finally, the personalization data would need to be sent out of the
TEE (encrypted in an SGX encalve-to-enclave manner) to the REE's installation app, which
would pass this data to the installed Untrusted Application, which would in turn send this data
to the SGX enclave (TA). This complexity is due to the fact that each SGX enclave is separate
and does not have direct communication to other SGX enclaves.

In ARM TrustZone based environments, the Untrusted Application and TA may or may not be
bundled together. This differs from SGX since in TrustZone the TA lifetime is not inherently tied
to a specific Untrused Application process lifetime as occurs in SGX.  A TA is loaded by
a trusted OS running in the TEE, where the trusted OS is separate from the OS in the REE.
Thus Cases 2 and 3 are equally applicable.  In addition, it is possible for TAs to communicate
with each other without involving the Untrusted Application, and so the complexity of Case 1
is lower than in the SGX example, and so Case 1 is possible as well though still more
complex than Cases 2 and 3.

## Entity Relations

This architecture leverages asymmetric cryptography to
authenticate a device to a TAM. Additionally, a TEE
in a device authenticates a TAM and TA signer. The
provisioning of Trust Anchors to a device may be different from
one use case to the other. A device administrator may want to
have the capability to control what TAs are allowed.
A device manufacturer enables verification of the TA signers
and TAM providers; it may embed a list of default Trust Anchors
that the signer of an allowed TA's signer certificate should
chain to. A device administrator may choose to accept a subset
of the allowed TAs via consent or action of downloading.

{: #experience title="Developer Experience"}

{{experience}} shows an application developer building
two applications: 1) an Untrusted Application; 2) a TA
that provides some security functions to be run inside
a TEE. At step 2, the application developer uploads the
Untrusted Application (2a) to an Application Store. The Untrusted
Application may optionally bundle the TA binary. Meanwhile,
the application developer may provide its TA to a TAM provider
that will be managing the TA in various devices. 3. A user
will go to an Application Store to download the Untrusted
Application. The Untrusted Application will trigger TA installation
by initiating communication with a TAM. This is the step 4. The Untrusted Application
will get messages from TAM, and interacts with device
TEE via an Agent.

The main components consist of a set of standard messages created by
a TAM to deliver TA management commands to a device,
and device attestation and response messages created by a TEE that
responds to a TAM's message.

It should be noted that network communication capability is generally
not available in TAs in today's TEE-powered devices.  Trusted
Applications need to rely on a broker in the REE to interact
with a TEE for network message exchanges.  Consequently, a TAM generally
communicates with an Untrusted Application about how it gets messages
that originate from a TEE inside a device.  Similarly, a TA or TEE
generally gets messages from a TAM via 
a TEEP Broker in this protocol architecture, not directly
from the network.

It is imperative to have an interoperable protocol to communicate
with different TAMs and different TEEs in different devices.
This is the role of the
Broker, which is a software component that bridges communication
between a TAM and a TEE. Furthermore the Broker communicates with a Agent
inside a TEE that is responsible to process TAM requests.
The Broker in REE does not need to know the actual
content of messages except for the TEE routing information.

# Keys and Certificate Types

This architecture leverages the following credentials, which allow
delivering end-to-end security between a TAM and a TEEP Agent,
without relying on any transport security.

{{keys}} summarizes the relationships between various keys and where
they are stored.  Each public/private key identifies an SP, TAM, or TEE,
and gets a certificate that chains up to some CA.  A list of trusted
certificates is then used to check a presented certificate against.

Different CAs can be used for different
types of certificates.  TEEP messages are always signed, where the signer
key is the message originator's private key such as that of a TAM,
or a TEE's private key.  In addition to the keys shown in {{keys}},
there may be additional keys used for attestation.  Refer to the 
RATS Architecture for more discussion.

The TEE key pair and certificate are used for authenticating the TEE
to a remote TAM.  Often, the key pair is burned into the TEE by the
TEE manufacturer and the key pair and its certificate are valid for
the expected lifetime of the TEE.  A TAM provider is responsible
for configuring its TAM with the manufacturer certificates or CAs
that are used to sign TEE keys.

The TAM key pair and certificate are used for authenticating a TAM
to a remote TEE.  A TAM provider is responsible for acquiring a
certificate from a CA that is trusted by the TEEs it manages.

The SP key pair and certificate are used to sign TAs that the TEE
will consider authorized to execute.  TEEs must be configured with
the CAs that it considers authorized to sign TAs that it will execute.

## Trust Anchors in TEE

A TEEP Agent's Trust Anchor store contains a list of Trust Anchors, which
are CA certificates that sign various TAM certificates.  The list
is typically preloaded at manufacturing time, and
can be updated using the TEEP protocol if the TEE has some form of
"Trust Anchor Manager TA" that has Trust Anchors in its configuration data.
Thus, Trust Anchors can be updated similar to updating the configuration data
for any other TA.

When Trust Anchor update is carried out, it is imperative that any update
must maintain integrity where only authentic Trust Anchor list from
a device manufacturer or a Device Administrator is accepted. This calls
for a complete lifecycle flow in authorizing who can make Trust Anchor
update and whether a given Trust Anchor list are non-tampered from the
original provider. The signing of a Trust Anchor list for integrity
check and update authorization methods are desirable to be developed.
This can be addressed outside of this architecture document.

Before a TAM can begin operation in the marketplace to support a
device with a particular TEE, it must obtain a TAM
certificate from a CA that is listed in the Trust Anchor store of the TEE.

## Trust Anchors in TAM

The Trust Anchor store in a TAM consists of a list of Trust Anchors, which
are CA certificates that sign various device TEE certificates.  A TAM will accept a
device for TA management if the TEE in the device uses a TEE certificate
that is chained to a CA that the TAM trusts.

## Scalability

This architecture uses a PKI.  Trust Anchors exist on the devices to
enable the TEE to authenticate TAMs, and TAMs use Trust Anchors to
authenticate TEEs.  Since a PKI is used, many intermediate CA
certificates can chain to a root certificate, each of which can issue
many certificates.  This makes the protocol highly scalable.  New
factories that produce TEEs can join the ecosystem.  In this case,
such a factory can get an intermediate CA certificate from one of the
existing roots without requiring that TAMs are updated with
information about the new device factory.  Likewise, new TAMs can
join the ecosystem, providing they are issued a TAM certificate that
chains to an existing root whereby existing TEEs will be allowed to
be personalized by the TAM without requiring changes to the TEE
itself.  This enables the ecosystem to scale, and avoids the need for
centralized databases of all TEEs produced or all TAMs that exist.

## Message Security

Messages created by a TAM are used to deliver TA
management commands to a device, and device attestation and
messages created by the device TEE to respond to TAM messages.

These messages are signed end-to-end between a TEEP Agent and a TAM, and are typically encrypted such
that only the targeted device TEE or TAM is able to decrypt and view
the actual content.

# TEEP Broker

A TEE and TAs often do not have the capability to directly communicate
outside of the hosting device.  For example, GlobalPlatform
{{GPTEE}} specifies one such architecture.  This calls for a software
module in the REE world to handle network communication with a TAM.

A TEEP Broker is an application component
running in the REE of the device or an SDK that facilitates
communication between a TAM and a TEE.  It also provides interfaces for
Untrusted Applications to query and trigger TA installation that the
application needs to use.

An Untrusted Application might communicate with the TEEP Broker at runtime
to trigger TA installation itself. Or an Untrusted Application might simply
have a metadata file that describes the TAs it depends on and the associated TAM(s) for each TA,
and an REE Application Installer can inspect this
application metadata file and invoke the TEEP Broker to trigger TA installation
on behalf of the Untrusted
Application without requiring the Untrusted Application to run first.

## Role of the TEEP Broker

A TEEP Broker abstracts the message exchanges with a TEE in a device.
The input data is originated from a TAM or the first initialization
call to trigger a TA installation.

The Broker doesn't need to parse a message content received from a TAM
that should be processed by a TEE.
When a device has more than one TEE, one TEEP Broker per TEE could
be present in REE. A TEEP Broker interacts with a TEEP Agent inside
a TEE.

A TAM message may indicate the target TEE where a TA should be installed.
A compliant TEEP protocol should include a target TEE identifier for a
TEEP Broker when multiple TEEs are present.

The Broker relays the response messages generated from a TEEP Agent in a TEE
to the TAM. The Broker is not expected to handle any network connection
with an application or TAM.

The Broker only needs to return an error message if the TEE is
not reachable for some reason.  Other errors are represented as
response messages returned from the TEE which will then be passed to
the TAM.

## TEEP Broker Implementation Consideration

   A Provider should consider methods of distribution, scope and
   concurrency on devices and runtime options when implementing a TEEP Broker.
   Several non-exhaustive options are discussed below.  Providers are
   encouraged to take advantage of the latest communication and platform
   capabilities to offer the best user experience.

### TEEP Broker APIs

The following conceptual APIs exist from a TEEP Broker to a TEEP Agent:

1. RequestTA: A notification from an REE application (e.g., an installer,
   or a normal application) that it depends on a given TA, which may or may not
   already be installed in the TEE.

2. ProcessTeepMessage: A message arriving from the network, to be delivered
   to the TEEP Agent for processing.

3. RequestPolicyCheck: A hint (e.g., based on a timer) that the TEEP Agent
   may wish to contact the TAM for any changes, without the device itself
   needing any particular change.

4. ProcessError: A notification that the TEEP Broker could not deliver an outbound
   TEEP message to a TAM.

For comparison, similar APIs may exist on the TAM side, where a Broker may or may not
exist (depending on whether the TAM uses a TEE or not):

1. ProcessConnect: A notification that an incoming TEEP session is being requested by a TEEP Agent.

2. ProcessTeepMessage: A message arriving from the network, to be delivered
   to the TAM for processing.

For further discussion on these APIs, see {{I-D.ietf-teep-otrp-over-http}}.

### TEEP Broker Distribution

The Broker installation is commonly carried out at OEM time. A user
can dynamically download and install a Broker on-demand.

### Number of TEEP Brokers

There should be generally only one shared TEEP Broker in a device.
The device's TEE vendor will most probably supply one Broker. When
multiple TEEs are present in a device, one TEEP Broker per TEE may be used.

When only one Broker is used per device, the Broker provider is responsible
to allow multiple TAMs and TEE providers to achieve interoperability.  With a
standard Broker interface, each TAM can implement its own SDK for its SP
Untrusted Applications to work with this Broker.

Multiple independent Broker providers can be used as long as they have
standard interface to an Untrusted Application or TAM SDK.  Only one
Broker is generally expected in a device.

# Attestation
Attestation is the process through which one entity (an Attester) presents "evidence", in the form
of a series of claims, to another entity (a Verifier), and provides sufficient proof that the claims
are true. Different verifiers may have different standards for attestation proofs
and not all attestations are acceptable to every verifier.  A third entity (a Relying Party)
can then use "attestation results", in the form of another series of claims, from a Verifier
to make authorization decisions.

In TEEP, as depicted in {{attestation-roles}},
the primary purpose of an attestation is to allow a device (the Attester) to prove to TAMs
(the Relying Parties) that a TEE in the device has particular properties, was built by a particular
manufacturer, or is executing a particular TA. Other claims are possible; TEEP
does not limit the claims that may appear in evidence or attestation results,
but defines a minimal set of attestation result claims
required for TEEP to operate properly. Extensions to these claims are possible.
Other standards or groups may define the format and semantics
of extended claims.

{: #attestation-roles title="TEEP Attestation Roles"}        

As of the writing of this specification, device and TEE attestations have not been standardized
across the market. Different devices, manufacturers, and TEEs support different attestation
algorithms and mechanisms. In order for TEEP to be inclusive, it is agnostic to the format of evidence,
allowing proprietary or standardized formats to be used between a TEE and a verifier (which may or may not
be colocated in the TAM). However, it should be recognized
that not all verifiers may be able to process all proprietary forms of attestation evidence.
Similarly, the TEEP protocol is agnostic as to the format of attestation results, and the protocol
(if any) used between the TAM and a verifier, as long as they convey at least the required set of claims
in some format.

The assumptions which may apply to an attestation have to do with the quality of the attestation
and the quality and security provided by the TEE, the device, the manufacturer, or others involved
in the device or TEE ecosystem.
Some of the assumptions that might apply to an attestations include (this may not be a comprehensive list):

  - Assumptions regarding the security measures a manufacturer takes when provisioning keys into devices/TEEs;

  - Assumptions regarding what hardware and software components have access to the Attestation keys of the TEE;

  - Assumptions related to the source or local verification of claims within an attestation prior to a TEE signing a set of claims;

  - Assumptions regarding the level of protection afforded to attestation keys against exfiltration, modification, and side channel attacks;

  - Assumptions regarding the limitations of use applied to TEE Attestation keys;

  - Assumptions regarding the processes in place to discover or detect TEE breeches; and

  - Assumptions regarding the revocation and recovery process of TEE attestation keys.

TAMs must be comfortable with the assumptions that are inherently part of any attestation result
they accept. Alternatively, any TAM may choose not to accept an attestation result generated using evidence from
a particular manufacturer or device's TEE based on the inherent assumptions. The choice and policy
decisions are left up to the particular TAM.

Some TAMs may require additional claims in order to properly authorize a device or TEE. These
additional claims may help clear up any assumptions for which the TAM wants to alleviate. The specific
format for these additional claims are outside the scope of this specification, but the TEEP protocol
allows these additional claims to be included in the attestation messages.

## Information Required in TEEP Claims

  - Device Identifying Info: TEEP attestations must uniquely identify a device to the TAM and SP. This
    identifier allows the TAM to provide services unique to the device, such as managing installed
    TAs, and providing subscriptions to services, and locating device-specific keying material to
    communicate with or authenticate the device. Additionally, device manufacturer information must
    be provided to provide better universal uniqueness qualities without requiring globally unique
    identifiers for all devices.

  - TEE Identifying info: The type of TEE that generated this attestation must be identified. Standard
    TEE types are identified by an IANA number, but also must include version identification information
    such as the hardware, firmware, and software version of the TEE, as applicable by the
    TEE type. TEE manufacturer information for the TEE is
    required in order to disambiguate the same TEE type created by different manufacturers and
    resolve potential assumptions around manufacturer provisioning, keying and support for the TEE.

  - Liveness Proof: A claim that includes liveness information must be included, such as a nonce
    or timestamp.

  - Requested Components: A list of zero or more components (TAs or other dependencies needed by a TEE)
    that are requested by some depending app, but which are not currently installed in the TEE.

# Algorithm and Attestation Agility

RFC 7696 {{RFC7696}} outlines the requirements to migrate from one
mandatory-to-implement algorithm suite to another over time.
This feature is also known as crypto agility. Protocol evolution
is greatly simplified when crypto agility is already considered
during the design of the protocol. In the case of the Trusted Execution Provisioning
(TEEP) Protocol the diverse range of use cases, from trusted app
updates for smart phones and tablets to updates of code on
higher-end IoT devices, creates the need for different
mandatory-to-implement algorithms already from the start.

Crypto agility in TEEP concerns the use of symmetric as well
as asymmetric algorithms. Symmetric algorithms are used for
encryption of content whereas the asymmetric algorithms are
mostly used for signing messages.

In addition to the use of cryptographic algorithms in TEEP there
is also the need to make use of different attestation technologies.
A Device must provide techniques to inform a TAM about the
attestation technology it supports. For many deployment cases it
is more likely for the TAM to support one or more attestation
techniques whereas the Device may only support one.

# Security Considerations

## TA Trust Check at TEE

A TA binary is signed by a TA signer certificate.  This TA signing
certificate/private key belongs to the SP, and may be self-signed
(i.e., it need not participate in a trust hierarchy).  It is the
responsibility of the TAM to only allow verified TAs from trusted SPs
into the system.  Delivery of that TA to the TEE is then the
responsibility of the TEE, using the security mechanisms provided by
the protocol.

We allow a way for an Untrusted Application to check the
trustworthiness of a TA.  A TEEP Broker has a function to allow an
application to query the information about a TA.

An Untrusted Application may perform verification of the TA by
verifying the signature of the TA.  An application can do additional
trust checks on the certificate returned for this TA.  It might trust
the TAM, or require additional SP signer trust chaining.

## One TA Multiple SP Case

A TA for multiple SPs must have a different identifier per SP.  They
should appear as different TAs when they are installed in the same
device.

## Broker Trust Model

A TEEP Broker could be malware in the vulnerable REE.  An Untrusted
Application will connect its TAM provider for required TA
installation.  It gets command messages from the TAM, and passes the
message to the Broker.

The architecture enables the TAM to communicate with the device's TEE
to manage TAs.  All TAM messages are signed and sensitive
data is encrypted such that the TEEP Broker cannot modify or capture
sensitive data.

## Data Protection at TAM and TEE

The TEE implementation provides protection of data on the device.  It
is the responsibility of the TAM to protect data on its servers.

## Compromised CA

A root CA for TAM certificates might get compromised.  Some TEE Trust
Anchor update mechanism is expected from device OEMs.  TEEs are
responsible for validating certificate revocation about
a TAM certificate chain.

If the root CA of some TEE device certificates is compromised, these
devices might be rejected by a TAM, which is a decision of the TAM
implementation and policy choice.  TAMs are responsible for validating
any intermediate CA for TEE device certificates.

## Compromised TAM

Device TEEs are responsible for validating the supplied TAM certificates
to determine that the TAM is trustworthy.

## Certificate Renewal

TEE device certificates are expected to be long lived, longer
than the lifetime of a device.  A TAM certificate usually has a
moderate lifetime of 2 to 5 years.  A TAM should get renewed or
rekeyed certificates.  The root CA certificates for a TAM, which are
embedded into the Trust Anchor store in a device, should have long
lifetimes that don't require device Trust Anchor update.  On the
other hand, it is imperative that OEMs or device providers plan for
support of Trust Anchor update in their shipped devices.

## Keeping Secrets from the TAM

In some scenarios, it is desirable to protect the TA binary or configuration
from being disclosed to the TAM that distributes them.  In such a scenario,
the files can be encrypted end-to-end between an SP and a TEE.  However, there
must be some means of provisioning the decryption key into the TEE and/or some
means of the SP securely learning a public key of the TEE that it can use to
encrypt.  One way to do this is for the SP to run its own TAM, merely to
distribute the decryption key via the TEEP protocol, and the key file can be a
dependency in the manifest of the encrypted TA.  Thus, the TEEP Agent would
look at the TA manifest, determine there is a dependency with a TAM URI of the
SP's TAM. The Agent would then install the dependency, and then continue with
the TA installation steps, including decrypting the TA binary with the relevant key.
